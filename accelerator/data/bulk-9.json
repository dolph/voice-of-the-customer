(we're so lucky).um, we don't want to keep the phone and pay the remaining balance, which is why we upgraded. that's what next promotes, you can upgrade without having to pay off the balance. we returned the phones right away, and they were both delivered! they must have misplaced the first one for a while (on accident or purpose?) and then when they finally checked it, said it was too late and sent it back. not fair!what do i do? who do i contact? how can i show my saved pictures of the tracking information showing delivered? if i did my part and dropped it off at usps, the rest is out of my hands, and i should not be charged.anyone deal with this before?",

      "text": "xtremely frustrated with wwireless right now. my family and i recently moved overseas for a 6 month work assignment. after looking at my different options for overseas data/phone plans,i decided the best thing would be to suspend my plan for the 6 month period i am over here (paying 10 dollars per line while i am here to keep my number once i return) and get a sim card from one of the local carriers. seems simple enough, right? wrong. not when it comes to wwireless. in order to get a new sim card from a carrier herewwireless needs to unlock my iphone. fine. i call, pay off my phone and submit a request to have my phone unlocked. one day later i get an email that my request has been denided. i call to try and find out why i have been denied. spend 47 minutes on the phone only to be told that under normal circumstances my request should have been approved (all the information i submitted is correct, and i am eligible to have my phone unlocked) but there must be something wrong with their system keeping my request from being approved. so the first rep i talk to (who although not helpful was very nice) tells me he will create a case to be reviewed in 2 days. keep in mind i am currently in a foreign country with my wife and two small children- and none of us have a phone that works when we are out and about without wifi. so i am supposed to be happy with them reviewing my 'case' in two days time while i leave and go to work, and leave my wife on her own in a foreign city without cellular data to help her navigate? because wwireless is having a glitch and can't unlock my phone? i explain this to him and he refers me to a 'specialist' who tell me his solution to my problem is for me to pay wwireless 10 dollars a day to have access to my domestic data plan until they work out the 'glitch' with unlocking my phone. because i really want to pay this company more money because of a problem they can't solve? completely unacceptable, and this second representative was extremely rude and condescending. so i am currently waiting for them to review my 'case' but have a hunch they will find some way to make unlocking my phone more difficult than it has already been, and i will have no choice but to buy a completely new phone from a carrier here. mind you we have been loyalcustomers of wwireless for over 10 years. absolutely unacceptable service, and i have every intention of cancelling my plan and switching to another carrier when we are back in the states if this is not solved asap.",

      "text": " am a long time wwireless customer. i have had my landline with wwireless since they were bell south (probably 20 or more years) and i've had my internet with wwireless for as long as i've had internet service (a very long time).i am also a wsatellite customer and have been for 15+ years (long before wwireless bought out direct tv). needless to say i am a loyal customer.recently when my contract with my wireless provider expired i called the wwireless retention department to see if they could offer me a good deal to bundle my services and switch to wwireless wireless.the retention agent i spoke with was fabulous. he gave me a great deal to switch. i got off that phone call feeling like wwireless actually did care about me as a customer. i was so happy with my new plan. imagine my surprise when a couple of weeks later when i received my bill estimate and plan details the bill estimate showed none of the enticements i had been offered to switch. i had been told i would get a free iphone 7 plus a bogo iphone 7 as well as $650 in credit per line that i was transferring. the agent explained how the $650 credit per line would work as follows: i would get a $300 credit per line for all 3 lines i was transferring automatically just for switching. this should have resulted in me getting a $900 credit right off the bat. i would get the remaining $350 credit per line for turning in my old iphones at an wwireless store. he told me you cant get a much better deal than 2 free iphone 7s and $1900 in credits. i agreed.the bill estimate showed none of these credits. it also showed me as having 6bg when i was supposed to have 16gb. the retention agent told me my monthly bill would be $156.00 (which included 3 lines, 16gb of data and the monthly payment for 1 iphone- since my other 2 lines were free). it appears that was also incorrect as my plan only shows me as having 6gbs and a higher bill for 6gbs then he quoted for 16gbs. i am not sure how anyone could get by on 6gbs per month for 3 lines with one of those lines being used by a college aged person.the bill estimate shows a monthly charge for all 3 phones (no free phones) and no $900 automatic credit. when i received my bill estimate last friday (2/24) i called the landline retention department back they told me i would have to speak with the wireless retention department and transferred me. the person i spoke with in the wireless retention department told me that she saw no notes on my account about the deal the prior agent gave me and i basically if i wasnt happy i could turn in my phones. i told her there was no way that i was letting this go as i had already received and been using my phones and my relationship with my prior wireless company had been terminated. i explained that i did not imagine all the incentives i was offered to switch. i took notes of my new plan when i was on the phone with the 1st agent plus i had him on speaker phone the entire call so my husband heard every word that was said. plus there is a recording that says all calls may be recorded. i asked her to pull up the recoridng of my prior call. when she said she could not do that i requested to speak to a supervisor. she told me a supervisor would call me back before 11:00 p.m. that night. here we are 3 days later and still no return call from the supervisor.how does this happen? i had previously spent an hour and a half on the phone with the 1st retention person that gave me the deal. part of the reason the call took so long was because he was updating my account with my deals as we went. where did all those notes go? is wwireless in the business of offering deals then once the person switches over erasing those deals from the customers account? i feel like cancelling all my services with wwireless!",

      "text": "o whom it may concern: i have spentover ten hours so far in wwirelessempting to recover my early terminationand buyout charges. iwas a verizon customer with five lines to transfer. four smartphones were traded in and the fifthwas too old. i was promised to recover all buyout and early termination fees. this is why i switched. one of the lines took an extra month toswitch over as the iphone 7plus was on backorder. due to this i need to pay an extra month on my verizon account. i was unable to access my online verizon account as it was closed. this necessitated my needing to go into theverizon store on two occasions to have them print out myfinal bills (2).these bills pairedthe buyout/termination charges with the agreement numbers rather than the telephone number. on the second occasion i went to verizon they matched up the agreement number with the phone. i have been to the wwireless store personally on two occasions to try and straighten out this mwwirelesser. the first time a sales professional named kyle submitted all the information for me. after this i received notice from you that some information was missing. yesterday i went back to the wwireless store and kyle stated that he did not send the information on all four phones. i brought in the information again and a very capable female sales professional took over. ileft allinformation with her as she still had to fax over some paperwork. now i have received notice again that the information cannot bevalidated.i am awwireless/wsatellite customer at my home with phone, tv, and internet. i am a wireless customer with five lines. i am a professional person who does not have the time to deal with this inefficiency and lack of customer service. i will consider leaving wwireless in the very near future. i will be contacting the better business bureau and the dept. of consumer affairs if this is not straightened out. i will not waste any more of my time with this. elaine l[edited for privacy  please do not post personal information]",

      "text": " was given a special on 2 wwireless treks back in november 2016. i later cancelled the service for an ipad mini (because i didn't need it with the treks) but the cancellation was never executed and in february 2017, i finally escalated my issue and the device was cancelled. i was given a $20 credit because a record or note could not be found that i cancelled the service in november. there was a note for january 9, 2017that i called and cancelled the service but yet in february, the service was still active.i actually called onceper month to cancel because i saw it was still on my bill so the other notes were lost too.it's frustrating that these notes on my account get lost and wwireless is not holding themselves accountable for these notes or the order for cancellation. this also happened with my wwireless treks where it took several hours and trips to the wwireless store for them to finally find the notes that said my purchase was 100% free with the service obligation. i was finally credited with the over $200 of charges for my free treks. basically, for this recent issue, i had to pay $40 for service that i cancelled and subsequently got a $20 credit because of wwireless's inability to cancel a device. if this is happening to others in the wwireless customer base, the company is making quite a bit with this loophole  [edited to comply with guidelines]",
