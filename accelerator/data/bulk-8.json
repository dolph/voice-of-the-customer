      "text": "o whom it may concern,necessary information: i came over to wwireless in march or april of 2016 and signed up for a new account on a phone installment plan for the iphone 6.in september of 2016 i opted to upgrade to the iphone 7 plus after logging into my account and seeing that i could upgrade early. as i was doing so and going through the steps, the wwireless website asked me to please send back my current device.it did not list what device wwireless was expecting, it just said my \"current device\". so i did exactly this.when i recieved my new iphone 7 plus, i sent back the device i had switched to weeks before (lg g4) because theiphone had been acting strange.when i contacted customer service they had told me they were expecting an iphone 6 and if it was not returned i would be billed the remaining amount on the phone that i owed. i said okay, awesome - please send me back the lg g4 and i'll get this back to you asap.i was on the phone with over 6 representatives and 2 managers who told me that they could not contact the warehouse because it's an offline team. they also went on to say i would not be getting my lg g4 back and if i did not want to be charged over 400.00 for the iphone 6 i should send that in, too.now call me crazy but how is this a legal practice? your website tells me to send in my \"current device\", so i do. then you tell me it's not the device you were expecting but refuse to send me back a 300-400.00 phone that i sent by mistake and on-top of that also want the iphone 6?i never sent the iphone 6 back or the 7 plus and was charged over 1,000.00 with my current bill for not doing so. i am unhappy with wwireless's practices and even more upset no one helped me even after confirming that the warehouse did recieve the lg g4.how can i get some help and resolve this?",

($398). i called and they said some how all promotions off tv are gone even though we did a 2 year contract. has to go to back office for them to look at. no call back. then told iphone arent free when switching over, only 1 iphone is, okay fine, well they are still charging for both!totally unhappy, the customer service is terrible. no one wants to help you, cant give you an answers on the phone. makes you wait and still don't get answers. really wish i didnt switch! now onto seeing what phone company i can switch too. what a nightmare!",
