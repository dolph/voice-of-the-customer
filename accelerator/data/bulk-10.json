($60+$40+$40+$25+$40). these are not from a bill, but rather the cost summary under the view plan and features tab.online on my account the phone that is showing a charge of $25 is showing up as an iphone 5s. however, up until a few months ago this phone was a basic phone until it broke. when it broke i swapped the sim card into an iphone 5s.i called today to try and correct this issue but the service rep was not able to see what i was talking about.my big concern is that i will not be receiving the $40 discount after 2 months as the plan states that the 4th smartphone is free...and i will be billed for 3 smartphones and 1 basic phone.anyone have any ideas what to do?update:fixed it this evening.i finally got my hands on the phone and the internet did not work at all, even though i was told it was on the unlimited plan. so i called customer service and the person i got knew right away what the issue was. the issue was that their system still showed the imei for the old basic phone she used to haveinstead of the iphone 5s she has now. they updated their system witht the correct imei and the plan to show it as a smarphone and boom internet works. also, the account online is now showing a correct price of $220!it took me a while to get her vissual voicemail set up, but once i remembered how to use the voicemail-of-the-nineties, where you have to dial in and enter your pascode, i was able to finish setting it up.",
