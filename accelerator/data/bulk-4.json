      "text": " recently upgraded my wwireless u-verse and internet when my contract was expiring back in january. i was offered a (free) tablet (with a one time fee of $45, so much for free). i then asked the wwireless (i believe to be trained by wwireless) employee if there was any monthly fees. his response was no (i saved the online conversation (email transcript)) as proof of his response. a few days go by and i noticed a $10 wireless fee on my bill. i called and spoke to someone and said i was told there would be no monthly fees and i would like to cancel. at no point in time did she inform me that there was a $150 etf. check the recording of our conversation. a few weeks go by and now i notice i have a $367 bill. i call and spend 1.5 hours on the phone, i was told i would get a call back in a few days i'm still waiting on that call back. i went to two different wwireless stores no help there and another wasted 3 hours of my time. i call again and just keep getting bounced around from department to department. this guy says he will call me back again no call. i call again last week the women says she will handle it and she will be the last person i talk to about this, well it's been another five days and no call back. why do you treat your paying customers like this? is this how to do good business? i have proof that one of your employees told me there would be no monthly and then there ended up being a monthly fee. if i was told the correct information the first time i would of never renewed my service with wwireless. if this issue doesn't get resolved at the end of my contract i will no longer be a wwireless customer and i will tell all my family and friends about this situation and to avoid your service at all cost.",

      "text": " bought my galaxy s6 from wwireless. my contract was completed in november 2016. i am eligible for unlock. i have not upgraded by phone.the unlock portal refuses to unlock my phone. it tells me i recently upgraded.i contacted wireless customer sevice. they agree that i did not recently upgrade and should be able to unlock. i started a case. the result of the case was an email telling me i was not eligible to unlock because i recently upgraded.i called in, and started a second case. this time it was supposedly \"escalated\" with \"backup documentation.\" yesterday, i again received an email telling me i was not eligible to unlock because i recntly upgraded.very frustrating. several wwireless reps and i all agree i have not recntly upgraded and i am eliglble to unlock, but wwireless will not unlock. what can i do?",
