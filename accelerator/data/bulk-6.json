      "text": " walked into an wwireless mobility store today to establish an unlimited service account for my samsung galaxy s7 edge (in-hand). the rep was more than happy to assist me, but when i refused to provide my ssn i was told that wwireless requires it. i pointed out that the code of virginia, of which i am a resident, title 2.2. chapter 38. para 2.2-3808 \"collection, disclosure, or display of social security number.\", enacted in 1976 states:\" a. it shall be unlawful for any agency to:1.require an individual to disclose or furnish his social security number not previously disclosed or furnished, for any purpose in connection with any activity, or to refuse any service, privilege, or right to an individual wholly or partly because the individual does not disclose or furnish such number, unless the disclosure or furnishing of such number is specifically required by state law in effect prior to january 1, 1975, or is specifically authorized or required by federal law; or2. collect from an individual his social security number or any portion thereof unless the collection of such number is (i) authorized or required by state or federal law and (ii) essential for the performance of that agency's duties. nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prohibit the collection of a social security number for the sole purpose of complying with the virginia debt collection act ( 2.2-4800 et seq.) or the setoff debt collection act ( 58.1-520 et seq.).the sales rep told me that the ssn was \"wwireless's law\" which did not humor me, and was more than happy to let me walk out the store. before i left, i asked for the manager's card and a number to call.i started calling wwireless 1-800-331-0500 number before 10:00 a.m. and finally got to talk to a csr at 10:11. after explaining the circumstances, and citing the virginia law, i was passed to six (6) differentcsrs and supervisors (where i thought i was making progress). the final csr in mobility read the policy that stated wwireless \"requests\" a ssn, but nowhere in the policy did it state that a ssn was required to establish an account. biggest excuse is that it is needed for a credit check, which is not true. credit checks can be accomplished on a valid home address or a valid state vehicle operators license (both of which were provided). more importantly, the ssn is not a form of national identification and is used to report earnings to the irs as it's only secondary function.now, having been in the military for 20 years, i understand the provisions of the privacy act of 1974. more importantly, after having my identity data stolen on multiple times (to include the largest u.s. government data breach), i am not prepared to just give away my ssn. when i asked for a copy of wwireless's privacy document for pii, the csr was clueless.so my final transfer was to wwireless mobility so i could set up an unlimited pre-paid account (which i really do not want) so i could order a sim card and establish an account. to my surprise, i got a system that wanted my wwireless wireless phone number and would not transfer me to an agent. the system hung up on me at 12:00 p.m., the end of my marathon call for service.so i am posting this to the community so hopefully a cm will contact me and help me resolve this issue. i need this servicebecause some places i travel to does not have good verizon wireless service and a second provider (in this case - wwireless does). as a point of interest, verizon does not require ssn's in virginia, as well as other wireless providers.i believe that my only other alternative would be to file a complaint with the virginia state corporation commission for assistance. the easiest solution is to re-code the software to leave an ssn as an optional item and do the credit check on an address or driver license number. customer satisfaction will rise, and more services will be sold. today's wwireless customer satisfaction rating from consumeraffairs.com is less than 1.5 stars out of 5. in fact, the google store ratings were 2.1 of 5, and that should have alerted me not to go there. not a good sign.solved!go to solution.",
