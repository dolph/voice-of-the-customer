(the congestion actually seems to be related to the unlimited plans wwireless has been offering already, as before the first one was introduced, i rarely had less than 12 mbps both up and down). yet, this device still usually uses 25+ gb/mo, thanks to daytime use.all of my lte devices are affected by the congestion, even those that use much less than 1gb/mo.if the deprioritization threshold applies to wireless home phone and internet, it could be very difficult to tell the difference between slowdowns that are due to going over that threshold (my fault) or the congested tower (wwireless's fault).ps - a couple trees on my property blew down in a recent storm. there may be room to \"plant\" a new one.solved!go to solution.",

      "text": "(wwreless has officially answered me with this issue. i will share their response with you at the end of this post.) on the evening of february 17th, i used the mywwireless app to pay my bill. i rarely use the app, but i liked the option of paying my bill in 2 manageable portions on my galaxy s5. my original plan was to pay $150 that evening, then the balance of $289.03 the following week. i was using my home's wi-fi and my phone has always been reliable, but at a crucial moment during the transaction, the app momentarily froze, disappeared then reappeared showing 2 separate payments being made in the amount of $489.03 plus the $150.00! i immediately went to my bank account and saw the 2 pending payments, placing my account in the red. i called cs and was reassured that the 439.03 would be reversed in 24 hours. since it was a friday night and the banks would be closed on monday due to a federal holiday, i figured everything would be okay. boy, was i wrong. 24 hours later, the 439.03 was still on hold in my account. i spoke with another overseas cs rep and found out that the first guy placed 439.03 on hold until the next saturday, even though my remaining balance was only 289.03. fixed now, right? nope. i think i talked to every wwireless rep in india every day for a week, trying to get this 'hold' removed. i spent countless hours on hold, being transferred, being disconnected, told \"it's fixed\" or being hung up on by some rude supervisor with marginal english skills and an innocuous name like 'carl' or 'shirley'. my problem was that wwireless's hold on this money was causing overdraft fees to amass with every scheduled transaction. i couldn't just stop or suspend my car insurance or rental insurance payments and i believed what i was told by wwireless india. starting on friday the 17th until wednesday the 22nd, i was repeatedly reassured that the hold amount would be removed from my bank account, even though my bank stated that wwireless placed a 'hold' on the funds until the 23rd. for 1 week, i was a sole-income, single working parent who couldn't purchase groceries or gas. had cs been straight with me from the get-go and told me that my funds might be on hiatus for up to 10 business days, i could've gotten a payday loan on saturday morning, made a deposit and avoided all the od fees. nope, i got the broken english runaround, instead.i did plead my case to wwireless on their facebook page. my answer from scott: any refunded amount can take 7 to 10 business days. you should have been aware of that. the od fees are not our responsibility. sorry. oh, please fill out this consumer satisfaction survey.... just kidding. we deleted the link after sending it to you. wouldn't want a bad review. thanks for using wwireless!actually, i think wwireless's third world employees should know about the 7 to 10 day thing. i'm just one of the nameless, faceless working poor who have zero representation, yet contribute to wwireless's 13 billion in profits. my bank is a little richer, too. i'd switch internet and phone carriers, but i can't afford to. funny how they can take money in real time, yet sit on a refund for a week.",
