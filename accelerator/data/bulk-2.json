      "text": "n november, 2016, i signed up for wsatellite through wwireless and was encouraged to accept the \"free\" iphone offer which was not promoted in any ads i had seen. i was assured that my cellular bill would not increase because there would be no cost. i agreed to participate and noticed on my december bill increased from $76 to $191. when i phoned to inquirie, the costs were itemized as including a one-time $45 activation fee and i was assured that the january 2017 bill would show a \"$650 credit for the iphone which would be drawn down over 20 months\" so that i would not pay for the phone.on feb. 19, i called again because not only was there no $650 credit, there was a $21.67 charge for the iphone. i was assured that the next bill (the third since i began with wwireless) would show 3 credits of $21.67 for previous billing and that each bill thereafter would show a $21.67 charge balanced against a $21.67 credit. i asked three times and was told that there would never be a cost to me for the iphone.on feb. 22, i received the third bill which again had no credit and another $21.67 charge for the iphone. when i phoned this time, the first person said there was nothing she could do, so i asked to speak with a manager. she said she could read all the notes on my account stating exactly what i had been promised but that she could not issue a credit. she said she would send my account to another department which has to review claims before issuing credits. she said she could not give me a name or a phone number so that i could follow up and that she also could provide no timetable for wwireless to respond to my claim.this is an unbelievably confusing accounting system, but more importantly, very poor customer service. surely wwireless does not want the reputation of making promises without following through with their customers.can someone please explain this process, why wwireless has provided different responses to the same question, and clear the iphone charges from my account?",
